  Work to be done is in main.cpp

  Added GDI+ rendering to textures with preservation of alpha channel
  This means you can now load .gif through GDI+ (but not through D3DX)

+ Feb 20 / 2010 v0.0.1-boxedText
  This is a developmental branch where I'm trying to get boxedText to work.  Basically it should render to texture some text and lay a box behind it.  A bit like a dialog box.  See main.cpp for details.  Considering using a rendering toolkit like Qt, but that may be very heavy.  Another option was IWebBrowser2, instantiate an IE basically and use it to render text.  Probably not the best choice.

+ Feb 20 / 2010 v0.0.1-boxedText-merge
  BoxedText now working, rendered in DirectX.  GDI+ boxed text was stripped out (GDIPlusTexture::boxedText()) because of difference in kerning in d3d vs GDI+, even for the same font with the same parameters -- the computed size was still different.

+ Feb 20 / 2010 v0.0.2-lib
  Separated out code into a .lib file (for the engine core) and a "game" project, which uses the engine.
  
+ Feb 20 / 2010 v0.0.2-lib
  Window::drawBox().  Initially was bad version of the drawBox() (unnecessary use of a cached map), but that actually got lost due to misuse of git reset function.. shall remain unnamed.  Going to use modulating color instead on white tex, that's this version anyway.
  * Sprite scaling fixed to allow rotation.
  USE:  vec2Scale, rotation, vec2Trans, vec3Center
  DO NOT USE:  vec2ScalingCenter, scalingRotation, vecRotCenter, vec3Pos
